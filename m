Hi Vitor,

Okay. Would you mind sharing a branch with this material so Przemek and
I can have a look at it?

Unfortunately I don't have access to non-public specs, but I guess
Przemek has access to it. Any specific details you want to share
regarding secondary master/mastership handover in v1.1?

That's exactly what we're trying to sort out :-).

I don't remember mentioning OTG. I did mention the USB gadget model
which I thought was a good approach for the I3C slave feature, but
AFAICT, OTG is quite different from the I3C mastership handover
mechanism. Master/slave selection in OTG is based on a pin (ID pin
IIRC), and AFAIR the device can't change role dynamically (it has to be
unplugged). Can you be more specific about what you think should be
taken from the OTG approach?

I keep thinking we won't be able to address both things at the same
time. As I said many times, I3C slave support sounds orthogonal to the
I3C mastership handover bits. I know the master acts as a 'slave' when
it doesn't own the bus, but it's a rather specific slave profile (at
least if the secondary master only implements the master profile) where
only MR events can be sent/received. I don't think we should expose it
as an I3C slave (or gadget if we make an analogy with the USB subsystem)
in that case.

Can we please focus on I3C mastership handover here, and put I3C slave
support on the side. BTW, if you have a draft for the I3C slave
framework, don't hesitate to post it, that's something we can review in
parallel.

Regards,

Boris
