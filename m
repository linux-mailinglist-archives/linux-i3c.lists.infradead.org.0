Unfortunately not :-/, and it's now my turn to apologize for the late
reply.

Hm, I don't get that part. I thought we were supposed to add devices as
soon as we know about them. In case of HJ and assuming your master is
not currently owning the bus, the active master should send you a
DEFSLVS which should serve as a trigger for registering new devs on all
non active masters. Since registering new devices will trigger a
mastership handover to query devs info (PID + other stuff) we should be
all good, right?

Kind of, yes. We can probably just have a "want_to_acquire_bus" flag
set, and the partially registered/discovered devices present in the
master list would be registered automatically every time the master
acquires bus ownership. This way we can re-use this logic for any
operation that requires the master to own the bus to do something
specific.

That's a solution too, but it feels like a lot of generic code is
open-coded in the driver if we do it this way. I know I'm the one who
suggested this approach, but now that I see the code, I realize I was
wrong (sorry about that).

We should at least print an error/warning.

One more reason to switch to the new approach.

Ok, good.
