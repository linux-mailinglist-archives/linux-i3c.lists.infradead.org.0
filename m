If there's nothing HW specific in ->populate_bus(), then yes, it makes
sense to have it done in the core based on information extracted from
the DEFSLVS frame.

Sorry, I don't get what you mean here. Why would we want a list of
i3c_ccc_defslvs objects when i3c_ccc_defslvs already stores an
array of devices. I guess you meant a list of struct i3c_ccc_dev_desc
objects.

Can you be more specific? Where would you move the
i3c_master_acquire_bus_ownership() call? Note that we already
considered different options and the solution proposed here was the
cleanest race-free one.

No, it's not from a SW PoV. IBI are events I3C device drivers can
register a handler for, MR and HJ events are things the HC drivers are
expected to handle, and that's a big difference. While re-using the IBI
API to handle them should be doable I don't think it will make things
simpler.

Fully agree with that, that's still something we can consider
restricting afterwards. Remember that I3C is still not widely deployed
and we only have 2 controller drivers so far, so patching them should be
fairly easy if we decide to change the interface.

That's certainly something we should take care of, by restoring
previous device configs every time a bus handover happens. It will
probably involve some kind of collaboration between the core and device
drivers, because part of the configuration (everything that's set
through private SDR transfers) is only known by device users. The core
can take care of restoring IBIs config though.

Well, I guess the idea was to use the same flag for any kind of
deferred MR requests. Not sure the reason for this MR request is really
important since the same set of actions will be done anyway. Do you have
a use case where we need to know the reason of a MR? If that's the
case, or if we want to know it for debug purpose, I'd recommend adding
extra flags to express that while keeping the want_to_acquire_bus one.

I think we've tried that approach, and I wasn't happy with the end
result. Don't remember the exact reason, but it was something related
to extra complexity related to init/registration steps in HC drivers.
You can look at my previous reviews if you want more details.

How do we break existing code? Can you please be more specific when you
make such statements so we can fix the problems. And no, keeping kernel
APIs/interfaces stable has never been our goal. Actually, it's quite the
opposite: the I3C subsystem is new, and if we see some of the initial
functions/interfaces/hooks do not apply well to some of the new
features we want to support, we should fix them, instead of trying to
workaround them.

That's not so simple. You have cases where the DEFLSLVS CCC has been
received before the driver was loaded. In that case you should call
i3c_secondary_master_register() in the probe path. It's this extra
complexity about when to call i3c_secondary_master_register() (and
other init steps related to that) that I was complaining about with
this approach.

Again, please be more specific in your proposals. It's easy to come up
with some high-level suggestions like "you should be able to do it this
way", but unless you've actually tried you can't tell if that's possible
or cleaner. I wish you had taken part to the discussion when it started
and had followed the evolution of the patch series, this way you'd
realized that we tried some of the things you suggest here and decided
to do it differently because the end result was not so great.

Boris
