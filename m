We sorted that out in Przemek series already. Please base your work on
what Przemek did (or at least look at it carefully), otherwise we're
going to re-do/re-review the same things we did a few months back.

Couldn't these problems/limitations be addressed in the existing
implementation instead of re-implementing everything?

I wish you had tried to modify what Przemek started instead of starting
from scratch... Now someone will have to do the integration, but let's
move on. Please post an RFC (or a public branch) as soon as possible,
even if it's incomplete. It can even be something that doesn't compile.
The idea being to check what's missing/wrong in Przemek implementation
and see how we can merge the two.

Okay, I can't tell. Version 1.0 was already pretty clear to me with
regard to mastership handover.

That's where the fun is, isn't it? :P

What about the I3C slave controller API/framework? Would be interesting
to have someone work on that topic, and you seemed to be worried about
how it would interact with masters that expose a real slave profile, so
looking at it would be a good starting point IMHO.
