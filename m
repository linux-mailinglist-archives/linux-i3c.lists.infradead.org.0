Okay, can we have an estimate? Are we talking about days or weeks?

I'm not sure what that means, but okay.

That's kind of a basic feature when talking about mastership handover,
but sure, we can discuss it after your RFC has been posted.

Note that I'm not super happy to have to go back to square 1 and throw
away all of the work done by Przemek, especially since Przemek was the
first one to post a patchset and he never really said he didn't
want or didn't have time to continue working on this task (not even
mentioning the time I spent reviewing those patches...).

If Przemek is fine with this situation I'm okay making an exception,
but be aware that it's not how we usually do: the person that posts a
patchset first leads the thing (of course, it's even better if there's
some kind of coordination before the patch is posted).

BTW, you mentioned working on a lot of different topics, but most of
them were left unfinished (userspace i3cdev interface, I3C slave
framework/API, ...). Any plans to post RFCs on those aspects anytime
soon? I mean, there's plenty of topics to work on, and I'd really prefer
that each developer work on a different topic instead of duplicating the
effort...

Regards,

Boris
