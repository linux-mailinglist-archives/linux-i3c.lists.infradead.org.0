Okay, sounds reasonable.

This initialization has to happen at some point, even if drivers keep
doing transfers on the bus, but I guess we can try delaying that a bit
until all already queued transfers have been issued.

Yes.

Because then this function can't be used from inside the framework,
when the master already owns the bus. For i3c_dev_do_priv_xfers_locked()
that's not a problem, because we shouldn't use it inside master.c, but
that's an issue for IBI related functions
(i3c_dev_{enable,request,free}_ibi_locked()).

I'm fine changing ibi for sir. Can you send a patch doing that?

I don't think that's a problem, as long as we're not afraid of changing
things afterward. Keeping this implementation out-of-tree does not help
either since it forces potential users to apply the patches (or even
worse, re-implement the whole thing if they don't notice people have
already worked on the feature).

Fine, then post the code or push it somewhere so we can review it.

Sorry, didn't notice the DW driver was not patched in this series,
which is wrong. I guess that's what you meant when you said it was
breaking existing implems. Przemek, if you send a new version please
make sure to patch the DW driver to take API changes into account. Also
noticed that patch 4 breaks bisectability (users of the API should be
patched along with the API changes).

I don't think it fits only 'my use case' since I personally have no
particular use case to support.

> Even now, I don't see clear how to fit slave API in this use case.

Slave API is completely orthogonal. All we need is a way for secondary
slaves to switch between slave and master roles, which I guess is
something HW specific anyway. In any case, secondary masters that want
to expose real features (by real I mean something more than just MR
support, like a GPIO controller, a sensor of whatever feature that can
be implemented by a slave-only device) will still have to register both
a slave and a master controller (we could add a wrapper registering
both, but that's just a detail). Each role will use a different set of
APIs/interfaces.

Re-using what? You can't re-use the I2C or USB logic, simply because
none of them directly apply to I3C. What I said was that, conceptually,
I3C slave support would be something closer to USB gadgets than I2C
slaves, which has to do with how devices are exposed on the bus. The
concepts of BCR/DCR and PID look similar to the USB class, vendor and
product ID concepts and those are things that will be exposed by I3C
slave blocks so other masters on the bus can know what those slaves are
capable of and the standard interface (if any) they support.

Well, if you can split it like that and keep bisectability intact
(that means each step in the series has to compile and work correctly),
then why not. In any case, please share the code you have so we can
discuss the implementation.

Thanks,

Boris
